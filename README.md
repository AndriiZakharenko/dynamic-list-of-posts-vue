# Dynamic List of Posts

## 🎮 About the Project
In this project, I implemented an application that allows a logged-in user to view their posts. Users can create a new post linked to their `userId`, open the post in a sidebar to see its comments, and also have the ability to edit or delete posts.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **HTML** (BEM methodology for structured markup)
- **CSS** (For styling)
- **JavaScript** (For dynamic functionality)
- **Vue** (For the app structure and UI components)
- **API** ([Mate API](https://mate.academy/students-api))

## 🛠️ Tools & Dependencies
- **Bulma** – A CSS framework for responsive design  
- **Axios** – Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the API  
- **Vite** – A modern build tool for fast development  

## 📌 Features
✅ User can create a new post with their userId  
✅ Posts are displayed dynamically, with the ability to view comments
